      "\n",
      "Miss Maffucci made one simple change to her diet that helped her drop over 11 kg -LRB- 24 lbs -RRB- in just three months .\n",
      "\n",
      "For every meal , she substituted spiralized vegetables for bread , pasta , rice and potatoes.Here , she tells the Healthista website how she went from a size 14/16 to a size 8/10 so rapidly ...\n",
      "\n",
      "Scroll down for video\n",
      "\n",
      "Ali Maffucci , 28 , lost 11 kg -LRB- almost two stone -RRB- in three months through replacing pasta , bread and rice with spirazlied vegetables . She is pictured before -LRB- left -RRB- and after -LRB- right -RRB- her weight loss\n",
      "\n",
      "Now , Ms Maffucci weighs 10 stone , is a size 8/10 and is working on toning instead of losing weight\n",
      "\n",
      "After eating courgette noodles recommended by her mother , Ali Maffucci fell in love with the spiralizing tool .\n",
      "\n",
      "Not long after , she took to the internet with her blog , Inspiralized , where she began creating and sharing recipes using spiralized vegetables .\n",
      "\n",
      "Then in June of 2013 , Ms Maffucci quit her corporate job to become a full time blogger .\n",
      "\n",
      "However while she was running the website and sharing healthy recipes with her readers , she was far from a reflection of that herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "Without the structure of her old job , she gained what she called her ` blogging weight ' of 10 kg -LRB- 22 lbs -RRB- .\n",
      "\n",
      "The spiralizer is a razor-sharp cutting device that creates thin ribbons of fruits and vegetables .\n",
      "\n",
      "Originally a Japanese invention , it allows people to create nutritious , very low-calorie , low-carb ` pasta ' , ` noodles ' and ` rice ' from everyday fruit and vegetables , in less time than it takes to peel a potato .\n",
      "\n",
      "For example , it can spin a simple courgette into a generous bowl of ` spaghetti ' in a flash .\n",
      "\n",
      "Spiralize a sweet potato and in minutes you 'll apparently get a filling portion of ` rice ' with just half the calories and carbs of regular basmati .\n",
      "\n",
      "Nutritionists warn it is not a good idea to completely eliminate carbohydrates from the diet entirely , as they provide a range of important nutrients .\n",
      "\n",
      "However , many of us are guilty of eating too many carbs , and a spiralizer could help us cut down , said dietitian Vanessa Hattersley .\n",
      "\n",
      "She said : ` Many of us do tend to overload our plates with pasta , rice , bread and potatoes when they are on offer .\n",
      "\n",
      "A well-balanced meal should be a quarter protein , a quarter carbohydrate and half fruit and vegetables , so the spiralizer could play a really useful role in redressing the nutritional balance in a carb-heavy diet . '\n",
      "\n",
      "Being in her apartment all day with her kitchen nearby meant her constant snacking quickly led to weight gain .\n",
      "\n",
      "` It was n't necessarily that I was eating unhealthy food , it was more that I was eating a lot of healthy food .\n",
      "\n",
      "` I was eating a half a tub of almond butter instead of a little bit with an apple slice or the whole tub of hummus , ' Ms Maffucci said .\n",
      "\n",
      "` I was snacking on many healthy things , but eating too many of them . '\n",

      "\n",
      "` I felt like I was very lazy , even at night time .\n",
      "\n",
      "` My fiancé would come home and I would make dinner for him , and by the time we were done I would be exhausted , and I would just lay on the couch and probably snack on more food , ' Ms Maffucci said .\n",
      "\n",
      "Later that month , she scored a deal to write a cookbook , which meant she would have to be photographed and featured in it .\n",
      "\n",
      "That 's when she knew she had to turn things around . The ` blogging weight ' gain had left her at 12 stone and a size 14/16 , and she needed to look fit and healthy for the book .\n",
      "\n",
      "` I told myself , how could I promote this healthy lifestyle if I was n't living it myself ? '\n",
      "\n",
      "She had until late August -- about three months -- to transform her lifestyle so she could look and feel fit and comfortable during the photo shoot .\n",
      "\n",
      "She made a plan to get to 140-145 pounds -LRB- 66 kg -RRB- - by consistently exercising and eating her own spiralized meals minus the snacks .\n",
      "\n",
      "` I said myself `` I 'm gon na eat healthy spiralized meals for lunch and dinner , and that kept me satisfied and kept me fueled '' .\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "` It is delicious , after all . If you were to boil some pasta , drain it and then try to eat it , it would n't really taste good ; it 's sort of the same thing with spiralized food , ' she said .\n",
      "\n",
      "` What makes the dish delicious is the sauces and the cooking and the other things you put into it . '\n",
      "\n",
      "She said by eating food she normally would , and replacing pasta , rice , potatoes and processed food with spiralized vegetables , she did n't have to sacrifice her taste buds in the name of health .\n",

      "Ms Maffucci said she did n't find it difficult to stick to spiralized food -LRB- her recipe for spiralized courgette with a fried egg is pictured -RRB- . She said : ` It 's such a fun way to eat , you never get bored of what you 're eating '\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms Maffucci wrote a book , Inspiralized : Inspiring Recipes to Make With Your Spiralizer , following her weight loss\n",
      "\n",
      "` I always tell people , you wo n't notice a big change in your flavor profile but you 'll notice it in the way you feel afterwards and how full you feel , and you feel a lot lighter , ' she said .\n",
      "\n",
      "She even mastered how to incorporate weekend indulgences into her diet .\n",
      "\n",
      "` I think of all of the foods that I love to eat that are n't good for me and I literally sit and brainstorm and say how can I make this inspiralized ? ' she said .\n",
      "\n",
      "Her recipe for Blueberry Sweet Potato Waffles was one she came up with when she had a craving one hungover Sunday morning .\n",
      "\n",
      "After sticking with the spiralized food and staying true to her exercise schedule , Ms Maffucci reached 150 pounds -LRB- 68 kg -RRB- by early August , extremely close to her goal .\n",
      "\n",
      "Now she rests at ten stone , size 8/10 and is working on toning instead of losing weight .\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to her old lifestyle , she said she is much happier , focused and energised .\n",
      "\n",
      "` After I lost the weight , I would do something as little as writing a thank you note that before I would push off because I was so exhausted .\n",
      "\n",
      "` I would clean out my drawers at night instead of sitting on the couch and watching TV .\n",

      "The FA Cup has been through a rollercoaster of emotions over the years - and now it is taking an actual rollercoaster ride . The famous trophy was on show at Alton Towers theme park in Staffordshire ahead of this weekend 's semi-finals at Wembley , nestled in between an Arsenal fan and Reading supporter . The Gunners head into Saturday 's showdown as the favourites against the Championship side . But they almost suffered a huge upset at Wembley last year against Hull before coming from behind to win one of the most entertaining finals of all time . Arsenal supporter Max Benjamin -LRB- left -RRB- and Reading fan Richard Putterford -LRB- right -RRB- hold the FA Cup trophy The pair shake hands as they accompany the cup on a rollercoaster at the Alton Towers amusement park The trophy is treated to a series of dips and loops ahead of the FA Cup semi-final clashes this weekend The 3-2 victory , inspired by Aaron Ramsey 's late extra time winner , ended a nine-year trophy drought for manager Arsene Wenger and the Frenchman is desperate to keep Arsenal 's red and white ribbon on the cup . Reading , meanwhile , have never won the FA Cup . The furthest the Royals have reached in the competition is the last four , where they lost 3-0 at Molineux to eventual winners Cardiff ... in 1927 . Victory for the current holders could prove to be a good omen . If Arsenal triumph at Wembley again this year they would become the most successful side in FA Cup history , surpassing the record of 11 wins they currently share with Manchester United . Reading , of course , will do their best to deny the north London club . And Liverpool or Aston Villa will be out to get their hands on the cup on May 30 too . Whatever happens , it 's guaranteed to be a roller coaster of a ride . Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey -LRB- number 16 -RRB- scores the winning foal against Hull in last year 's FA Cup final Ramsey celebrates scoring in extra time to help Arsenal end a nine-year trophy drought at Wembley Manager Arsene Wenger -LRB- right -RRB- will be hoping that his side can retain the famous trophy this year @highlight The FA Cup is usually a rollercoaster of emotions @highlight Fittingly , the famous trophy was taken on looping ride at Alton Towers @highlight It was accompanied by an Arsenal and a Reading fan ahead of the pair 's semi-final at Wembley on Saturday @highlight Arsenal are the current holders of the competition and keen to retain it @highlight Liverpool and Aston Villa will contest the other semi-final on Sunday\n"

      "Bournemouth are set to hold off on expanding the capacity of their 12,000-seater Goldsands Stadium - as a tactic to help them next season . The away contingent are currently crammed into a corner of the ground between the South Stand and the East Stand . Manager Eddie Howe prefers the away fans not to be behind one of the goals to give his players a psychological advantage when they are playing in front of a home crowd . Bournemouth will not look to increase the capacity of their 12,000-seater Goldsands Stadium Premier League rules state clubs must give the away fans 10 per cent of their overall allocation Bournemouth officials are considering doubling the South Stand from its current 2,500 seats to 5,000 , taking the whole capacity to just less than 15,000 . However , Premier League regulations state that clubs must provide at least 10 per cent of their overall allocation of tickets for away supporters . This would mean that , should Bournemouth press ahead with the expansion , away fans might then have to be positioned behind one of the goals - against Howe 's wishes . Last year , the possibility of increasing the stadium to 18,000 by filling in all four corners was discussed , but the logistics of that make it unlikely . Just to expand the South Stand would cost the club £ 1.8 million and , over the course of a season , they would only accrue £ 900,000 in ticket sales . Any construction would , therefore , be for the benefit of fans as opposed to any financial advantage . Manager Eddie Howe is reluctant to change the position of the away fans to behind the goal With a capacity of 12,000 Bournemouth look set to have the smallest ground in the Premier League The club will have to install undersoil heating during the summer to adhere to Premier League rules , something which was not a requirement in the Championship . The press box , which at present separates home and away fans in the East Stand , will also move to the opposite side of the pitch to be closer to the dugouts . Stewards or netting would be put between supporters from either side to keep them apart during matches . Bournemouth only had the South Stand built when they won promotion to the Championship in 2013 , such has been their rapid rise up the football pyramid . @highlight Manager Eddie Howe does not like having away fans behind the goal @highlight The club will install undersoil heating in time for next season @highlight Bournemouth all but secured promotion with a 3-0 win over Bolton\n"
